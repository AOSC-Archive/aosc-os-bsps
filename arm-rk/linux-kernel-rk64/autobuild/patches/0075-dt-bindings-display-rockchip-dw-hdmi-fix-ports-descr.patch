Subject: [PATCH 75/76] dt-bindings: display: rockchip: dw-hdmi: fix ports
 description

Current port description doesn't cover all possible cases. It currently
expects one single port with two endpoints.

When the HDMI connector is described in the device tree there can be two
ports, first one going to the VOP and the second one going to the connector.

Also on SoCs which only have a single VOP there will be only one
endpoint instead of two.

This patch addresses both issues. With this there can either be a single
port ("port") , or two of them ("port@0", "port@1") when the connector
is also in the device tree. Also the first or only port can either have
one endpoint ("endpoint") for single VOP SoCs or two ("endpoint@0",
"endpoint@1") for dual VOP SoCs.
