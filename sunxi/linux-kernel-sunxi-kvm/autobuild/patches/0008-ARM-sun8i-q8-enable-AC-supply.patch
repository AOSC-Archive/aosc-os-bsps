Subject: [PATCH 08/88] ARM: sun8i: q8: enable AC supply

Q8 tablets usually come with an power-only barrel which is connected to
the ACIN of AXP223 PMIC.

Enable AC power supply in Q8 DTSI file.

As some non-Q8 tablets are known to have only USB power supply, the AC
supply is not enabled in reference design tablet DTSI file.
