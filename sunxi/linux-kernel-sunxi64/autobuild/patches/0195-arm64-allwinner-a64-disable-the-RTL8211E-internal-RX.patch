Subject: [PATCH 195/329] arm64: allwinner: a64: disable the RTL8211E internal
 RX delay on Pine64+

Some Pine64+ boards have a broken RTL8211E PHY, which cannot work
reliably in 1000Base-T mode with default configuration.

A solution is passed to Pine64, which is said to be disabling the
internal RX delay of the PHY.

Enable the hack by set the PHY mode to RGMII-TXID.
