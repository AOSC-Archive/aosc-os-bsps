Subject: [PATCH 002/329] ASoC: wm9712: fix replace codec to component

Since commit 143b44845d87 ("ASoC: wm9712: replace codec to component")
"wm9712-codec" got renamed to "wm9712-component", however, this change
never got propagated down to the actual board/platform drivers. E.g. on
Colibri T20 this lead to the following spew upon boot with sound/touch
being broken:

[    2.214121] tegra-snd-wm9712 sound: ASoC: CODEC DAI wm9712-hifi not registered
[    2.222137] tegra-snd-wm9712 sound: snd_soc_register_card failed (-517)

...
[   14.970443] ALSA device list:
[   14.996628]   No soundcards found.

This commit finally fixes this again.
