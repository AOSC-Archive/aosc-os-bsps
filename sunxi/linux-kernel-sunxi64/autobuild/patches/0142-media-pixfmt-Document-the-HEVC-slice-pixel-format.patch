Subject: [PATCH 142/147] media: pixfmt: Document the HEVC slice pixel format

Document the current state of the HEVC slice pixel format.
The format will need to evolve in the future, which is why it is
not part of the public API.

+        * ``V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_HEVC_PPS``

+	See the :ref:`associated Codec Control IDs <v4l2-mpeg-hevc>`.
+	Buffers associated with this pixel format must contain the appropriate
+	number of macroblocks to decode a full corresponding frame.
