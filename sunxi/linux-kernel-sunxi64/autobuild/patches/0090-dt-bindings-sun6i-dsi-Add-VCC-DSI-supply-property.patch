Subject: [PATCH 090/128] dt-bindings: sun6i-dsi: Add VCC-DSI supply property

Most of the Allwinner MIPI DSI controllers are supply with
VCC-DSI pin. which need to supply for some of the boards to
trigger the power.

So, document the supply property so-that the required board
can eable it via device tree.
