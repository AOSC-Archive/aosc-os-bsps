Subject: [PATCH 17/78] clk: sunxi-ng: allow CLK_DE to set CLK_PLL_DE for H3

Allwinner H3 features a PLL named CLK_PLL_DE, and a mod clock for the
"Display Engine 2.0" named CLK_DE. As the name indicated, the CLK_PLL_DE
is a PLL for CLK_DE.

Only CLK_DE and CLK_TVE have a parent of CLK_PLL_DE, and CLK_TVE is also
one part of the display clocks.

So allow CLK_DE to set CLK_PLL_DE (add CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT to it).
