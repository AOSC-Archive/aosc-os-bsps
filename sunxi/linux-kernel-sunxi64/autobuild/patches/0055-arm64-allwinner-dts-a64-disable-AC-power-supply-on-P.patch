Subject: [PATCH 55/77] arm64: allwinner: dts: a64: disable AC power supply on
 PinePhone

PinePhone has its ACIN and VBUS pins on the PMIC shorted. In this
situation, both power supplies will have the same status at the same
time, and input current limit will be done on VBUS side.

Disable AC power supply to prevent misleading infomation.
