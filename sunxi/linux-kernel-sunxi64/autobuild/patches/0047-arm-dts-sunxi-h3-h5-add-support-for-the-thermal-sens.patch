Subject: [PATCH 047/109] arm: dts: sunxi-h3-h5: add support for the thermal
 sensor in H3 and H5

As we have gained the support for the thermal sensor in H3 and H5,
we can now add its device nodes to the device tree. The H3 and H5 share
most of its compatible. The compatible and the thermal sensor cells
will be added in an additional patch per device.
