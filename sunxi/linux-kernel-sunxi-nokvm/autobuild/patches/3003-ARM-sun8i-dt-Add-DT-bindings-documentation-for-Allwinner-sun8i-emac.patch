+* Allwinner sun8i EMAC ethernet controller
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: should be one of the following string:
+		"allwinner,sun8i-a83t-emac"
+		"allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac"
+		"allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac"
+- reg: address and length of the register for the device.
+- syscon: A phandle to the syscon of the SoC
+- interrupts: interrupt for the device
+- clocks: A phandle to the reference clock for this device
+- clock-names: should be "ahb"
+- resets: A phandle to the reset control for this device
+- reset-names: should be "ahb"
+- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt
+- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt
+- #address-cells: shall be 1
+- #size-cells: shall be 0
+
+Optional properties:
+- allwinner,tx-delay: TX clock delay chain value. Range value is 0-0x07. Default is 0)
+- allwinner,rx-delay: RX clock delay chain value. Range value is 0-0x1F. Default is 0)
+Both delay properties does not have units, there are arbitrary value.
+The TX/RX clock delay chain settings are board specific and could be found
+in vendor FEX files.
+
+Optional properties for "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac":
+- allwinner,leds-active-low: EPHY LEDs are active low
+
+Required child node of emac:
+- mdio bus node: should be named mdio
+
+Required properties of the mdio node:
+- #address-cells: shall be 1
+- #size-cells: shall be 0
+
+The device node referenced by "phy" or "phy-handle" should be a child node
+of the mdio node. See phy.txt for the generic PHY bindings.
+
+Required properties of the phy node with "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac":
+- clocks: an extra phandle to the reference clock for the EPHY
+- resets: an extra phandle to the reset control for the EPHY
+
+Example:
+
+emac: ethernet@01c0b000 {
+	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac";
+	syscon = <&syscon>;
+	reg = <0x01c0b000 0x104>;
+	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 82 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
+	resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_EMAC>;
+	reset-names = "ahb";
+	clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_EMAC>;
+	clock-names = "ahb";
+	#address-cells = <1>;
+	#size-cells = <0>;
+
+	phy = <&int_mii_phy>;
+	phy-mode = "mii";
+	allwinner,leds-active-low;
+	mdio: mdio {
+		#address-cells = <1>;
+		#size-cells = <0>;
+		int_mii_phy: ethernet-phy@1 {
+			reg = <1>;
+			clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_EPHY>;
+			resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_EPHY>;
+		};
+	};
+};
