Subject: [PATCH 13/13] usb: typec: tcpm: do not send discover when attach as
 sink

According to PD 2.0 spec, sink shouldn't send discover; however some
docks will respond to discover even if they're attached as source, thus
creates altmodes on TCPM side that won't be properly unregistered when
DR_SWAP.

Remove the code that sets discover sending flag in sink attaching code.
