Subject: [PATCH 8/9] RFC: drivers/pwm/rk_pwm.c: Fix default polarity

In the code, the default polarity is set to positive/positive,
which is neither normal polarity or inverted polarity. It's
only the hardware default. This leads to booting linux with
wrong polarity setting.

Update the code to use PWM_DUTY_POSTIVE | PWM_INACTIVE_NEGATIVE
by default instead.
